Title: Analysis of Major Crime Indicators in Toronto (2016-2022)Dataset Source: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/major-crime-indicators/Introduction: The Major Crime Indicators (MCI) dataset provided by the Toronto Police Service contains detailed information about criminal incidents reported in Toronto from 2016 to 2022. This dataset includes data related to various crime categories, including Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, and Theft Over.Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the MCI data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between crime incidents and various factors such as time, location, and premises. The insights obtained from this analysis will be useful for informing public safety strategies, resource allocation, and policy formulation.Data Preparation: The MCI dataset was downloaded from the official Open Data portal of the City of Toronto. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed to remove any inconsistencies or missing data. The cleaned dataset was then used for the analysis.Analysis and Visualization: Various statistical and visual analysis techniques were used to analyze the MCI data. The analysis included crime counts by category, crime trends over time, correlation analysis between crime incidents and other factors such as location, premises, and time. The visualizations included pie charts, line charts, and scatter plots.Findings: The analysis of MCI data revealed some interesting findings. Assault was consistently the most reported crime category throughout the period of 2016-2022. Auto theft showed an increasing trend, while Break and Enter, Robbery, and Theft Over remained relatively stable. There was a positive correlation between crime incidents and high-density neighborhoods. Crime incidents were also found to be more frequent during nighttime hours and on weekends.Recommendations: Based on the findings, we recommend that law enforcement agencies prioritize the prevention and reduction of Assault and Auto Theft incidents. Increased patrolling and surveillance in high-density neighborhoods and during nighttime hours could also help in reducing crime incidents. The analysis of crime data could be made more effective with the integration of more relevant data sources, such as weather and socio-economic data, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of crime patterns and trends.Conclusion: In conclusion, the analysis of MCI data provides valuable insights into crime incidents in Toronto. The findings of this analysis could be useful for informing public safety strategies, resource allocation, and policy formulation. The recommendations based on the analysis could be useful for law enforcement agencies and policymakers in developing effective crime prevention and reduction strategies.
